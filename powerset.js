/* Powerset

write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns its powerset.

The powerset P(X) of a set X is the set of all subset of X. For example, 
the powerset of [1,2] is [[], [1], [2], [1,2]].

Note that the sets in the powerset do not need to be in any particular order

SAMPLE INPUT

array = [1,2,3]

SAMPLE OUTPUT

[[], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]]

    const helper = () => {
